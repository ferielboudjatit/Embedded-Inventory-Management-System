## <b>NFC08A1 Polling Tag Detect NDEF</b>

This application reads/writes NDEF messages as well as work in CE mode

Example Description:

This directory contains a set of source files that implement a simple example based on ST25R3916.
------------------------------------
WARNING: When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating it
from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, assuming you started the project for the
Nucleo-L476RG board, remove from the IDE project the file stm32l4xx_nucleo.c in the Application/User
virtual folder and delete, from Src and Inc folders, the files: stm32l4xx_nucleo.c, stm32l4xx_nucleo.h,
stm32l4xx_nucleo_bus.c, stm32l4xx_nucleo_bus.h and stm32l4xx_nucleo_errno.h.
The same operations apply if you starts the project for another STM32 Nucleo board (e.g. for
Nucleo-L053R8, the files to be removed are stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.h,
stm32l0xx_nucleo_bus.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo_bus.h and stm32l0xx_nucleo_errno.h).
